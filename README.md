<h6>Preparation:</h6>
- Once its running, you must first tell it where the dialogue and soundtrack files are located. You can either copy an past the file paths in (by clicking the small :_ button), or use the built in file browser to navigate to them. You may also choose an alternative destination folder, and output file name if you wish, or just leave it at the defaults. At this point, you are ready to click begin.

This application was created in Turing, a programming language developed by HoltSoft with simplistic syntax in mind. It`s designed to provide a good start-up to get beginners into programming. It just so happens to be my first programming language. It got me hooked on programming so it seams they hit their mark. Unfortunately they closed development of the language, however it still exists and is available for download at http://compsci.ca/holtsoft/. There is a community there wrapped around a several programming languages, Turing being one of them.
